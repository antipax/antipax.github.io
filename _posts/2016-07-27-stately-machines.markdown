For those who are interested, here are the slides from my recent talk at Elixir Camp NYC 2016, "Stately Machines: OTP 19, Elixir, and `gen_statem`."

The talk broadly covers `gen_statem`: why you would use it, what its features are, and some nice examples of it in use. I also discuss my Hex package [`gen_state_machine`](https://hex.pm/packages/gen_state_machine) which wraps `gen_statem` in a nice Elixir interface.
